      <p>
       Iâ€™m Yash Ghodasara, a Full Stack Developer with a passion for teaching and coding.
I specialize in React and modern web technologies, helping students build real-world projects and master front-end as well as back-end development.
I also run a YouTube channel, CodeNest, where I create tutorials and courses to guide aspiring developers in their journey toward successful careers in tech.
Outside of coding, I enjoy continuous learning and sharing knowledge to inspire others to achieve their goals.
